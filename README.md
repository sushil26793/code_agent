# Vibe - AI-Powered Coding Agent

An intelligent coding assistant that helps developers write, debug, and understand code through natural language conversations. Built with modern web technologies and powered by advanced AI capabilities.

## Overview

Vibe is a full-stack application that combines conversational AI with real-time code execution, providing developers with an interactive environment to solve coding problems, learn new concepts, and prototype ideas quickly.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - Latest React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** - Accessible component library built on Radix UI
- **React Hook Form** - Performant form management with Zod validation

### Backend
- **tRPC** - End-to-end typesafe APIs
- **Prisma** - Type-safe database ORM
- **Clerk** - Authentication and user management
- **Inngest** - Durable workflow orchestration for AI agents

### AI & Code Execution
- **E2B Code Interpreter** - Secure sandboxed code execution
- **Inngest Agent Kit** - AI agent orchestration and memory management

### State & Data
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management

## Architecture Highlights

### Type-Safe API Layer
Used tRPC to eliminate the need for API documentation and ensure type safety from database to frontend. All endpoints are fully typed, reducing runtime errors.

### Component-Level Error Boundaries
Implemented granular error handling that isolates failures to specific components rather than crashing the entire application. Each section can fail independently with appropriate fallback UI.

### AI Agent Orchestration
Leveraged Inngest for durable workflow execution, enabling complex multi-step AI operations with built-in retry logic and state management.

### Secure Code Execution
Integrated E2B sandboxes to safely execute user-provided code in isolated environments, preventing security vulnerabilities while maintaining performance.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Managing complex AI workflows with multiple steps
**Solution:** Implemented Inngest for durable execution with automatic retries and state persistence

**Challenge:** Preventing one component failure from breaking the entire app
**Solution:** Built a comprehensive error boundary system with component-level isolation

**Challenge:** Type safety across client-server boundary
**Solution:** Used tRPC for end-to-end type inference without code generation

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Implement code diff visualization
- [ ] Support for more programming languages
- [ ] Integration with GitHub for code repository management
- [ ] Performance monitoring and analytics dashboard

## Performance

- Lighthouse score: 95+ on all metrics
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.2s
- Time to Interactive: < 2.5s
- Bundle size optimized with code splitting and lazy loading
